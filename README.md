# Code Reading Graz

There are so many great software projects that share their source code
available to the public. At Code Reading Graz we pick some of them and look at
the details. What can we learn about the architecture? What tools support the
project? How is maintenance and feature development organised?

As a group we will explore and discuss one application at a time, sharing our
thoughts and stories. Prepared presentations are welcome, but self-promotion is
discouraged, so please do not be an author or related to the code owners.

## FAQ

**How do I suggest a talk or topic?** We use [GitHub Discussions] to share
ideas, thougths, feedback, and discuss about upcoming topics. Please do not
hesitate to bring in your own presentation, any organizer will confirm and
contact you for discussing details. You can also share any idea on a topic or
software you would like to be read at an event.

**What criteria must a software source code fulfill to be considered?** We only
read through software that is public available. Further, you must not be the
owner or author of a project as Code Reading Graz is **not meant to host
self-promotions or advertisments**. For sure you can still be contributor to
an open-source application.

**As the event is taking place in Graz, are we going to talk in german?** No.
In order to keep the community as inclusive and diverse as possible, we stick
to english for all communication, presentations, and chatting.

**How does the format work for presentations?** Practically, its up to you.
The events are planned to last 2 hours. You can use this time flexibly, but
you must leave enough space for discussions. A preferred way of presenting is
interactive exploration in collaboration with all readers.

**As a reader, how do I prepare upfront for an event?** Topics or a certain
software will be announced ahead. You can read into, test the application, and
even prepare some notes or slides. However, there is no such thing as expected
preparation work. Come by and enjoy nice exploring sessions and discussions
with your code reading friends.

**Do I need to bring my laptop?** No. Feel free to have your computer with you,
yet there will be a machine (and large screen or beamer) ready that we can use.
