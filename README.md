# Code Reading Graz

It's like a bookclub but with software code.

There are so many great software projects that share their source code
available to the public. At Code Reading Graz we pick some of them and look at
the details. What can we learn about the architecture? What tools support the
project? How is maintenance and feature development organised?

As a group we will explore and discuss one application at a time, sharing our
thoughts and stories. Prepared presentations are welcome, but self-promotion is
discouraged, so please do not be an author or related to the code owners.

We're flexible with any kind of presentation, workshop, or discussion. In best
case we keep it similar to a bookclub:

- A topic (software, programming language, technology, etc.) is announced
  timely before the event.
- Readers are encouraged to look into the topic. You can prepare details, run
  specific showcases, or have a list of questions prepared you would like to
  share. However, there's no need to prepare at all - it can be fun to explore
  a project together, without having ever looked into it.
- As with a bookclub we do not follow specific goals in discussions. Everyone
  should feel welcome. Members are expected to understand that others have
  different opinions, as well as level of experience.
- Discussions are a great way to learn from each other. What are similar
  solutions to what we've just seen? How can it be implemented in a more
  efficient way? What would be the benefits and downsides?

## FAQ

**I'm in, Where and When?** It is planned to meet in the middle of each month
for about two hours in the evening. The location will be announced about two
weeks in advance.

**How do I suggest a talk or topic?** We use [GitHub Discussions] to share
ideas, thoughts, feedback, and discuss about upcoming topics. Please do not
hesitate to bring in your own presentation, any organizer will confirm and
contact you for discussing details. You can also share any idea on a topic or
software you would like to be read at an event.

**What criteria must a software source code fulfill to be considered?** We only
read through software that is public available. Further, you must not be the
owner or author of a project as Code Reading Graz is **not meant to host
self-promotions or advertisements**. For sure you can still be contributor to
an open-source application.

**As the event is taking place in Graz, are we going to talk in german?** No.
In order to keep the community as inclusive and diverse as possible, we stick
to english for all communication, presentations, and chatting.

**How does the format work for presentations?** Practically, its up to you.
The events are planned to last 2 hours. You can use this time flexibly, but
you must leave enough space for discussions. A preferred way of presenting is
interactive exploration in collaboration with all readers.

**As a reader, how do I prepare upfront for an event?** Topics or a certain
software will be announced ahead. You can read into, test the application, and
even prepare some notes or slides. However, there is no such thing as expected
preparation work. Come by and enjoy nice exploring sessions and discussions
with your code reading friends.

**Do I need to bring my laptop?** No. Feel free to have your computer with you,
yet there will be a machine (and large screen or beamer) ready that we can use.
