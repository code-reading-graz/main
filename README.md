# Code Reading Graz

There are so many great software projects that share their source code available to the public. At Code Reading Graz we pick some of them and look at the details. What can we learn about the architecture? What tools support the project? How is maintenance and feature development organised?

As a group we will explore and discuss one application at a time, sharing our thoughts and stories. Prepared presentations are welcome, but self-promotion is discouraged, so please do not be an author or related to the code owners.
