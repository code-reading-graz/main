# Code Reading Graz - Introduction

## Goals

Actually there are no goals, other than having nice discussions and everyone
should feel welcome.

## Style

A Bookclub for Software

- one topic per event (software, programming language, technology, etc.)
- prepare upfront or don't
- respect opinions and level of experience
- learn from each other

## Time & Duration

An evening in the mid of the month, around max. 2h.

## Topic Selection

Drop a suggestion at GitHub. We can discuss next at an event or Christoph
will choose.
